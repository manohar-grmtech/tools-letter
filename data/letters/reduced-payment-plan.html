                regret to inform you that I am unable to continue with my current payment plan due to some unfortunate
                circumstances that I am currently facing. But I want to continue my payments and become debt
                free.<br><br>After reviewing my present financial condition and my monthly budget, I find it a real
                necessity to request an alternative payment plan. I’m also requesting all other creditors for a reduced
                payment plan until my situation improves.<br><br>I’d like to offer a reduced monthly payment of
                $___________
                instead of the regular monthly payment of $ ____________ that I’ve been making each month.<br><br>I will
                resume my regular monthly payments as soon as I recover from this financial crisis and keep you updated
                about any change in my financial situation.<br><br>I hope you will understand my situation and
                acknowledge
                my request.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Your Signature<br>Your Name</p>
